# Country Data

Files are generated by our [International Data Pipeline](https://github.com/modelearth/data-pipeline/tree/main/international).  

The lookup/comtrade-commodity-2020-temp.csv file can be deleted once lookup files are added for years when the IDs change.  (Probably 2017)  

Possible source (but better to use the API to generate lookups): https://comtrade.un.org/data/
